= Userscript: Combine TiddlyWiki5 and search engine (Google) results

Have you ever been looking for something on Google and when you found the
answer, you wanted to make a note of it, did you realize that you already had
the answer in your TiddlyWiki? To avoid these situations, use this userscript
with TiddlyWiki on Node (at least 5.1.20).

* Install
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/[Greasemonkey] or
a compatible userscript-manager extension
(https://violentmonkey.github.io/[Violentmonkey],
https://www.tampermonkey.net/[Tampermonkey]) to your browser
* Add this script to it
* Set up `wikis` in the script (don't forget to save the changes)
* Start your Node based TiddlyWikis
* Go to https://www.google.com/ and search for anything
